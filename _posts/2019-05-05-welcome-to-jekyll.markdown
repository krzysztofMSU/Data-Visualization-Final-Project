## Data Visualization Final Project, Spring 2019

### *Introduction*
When we look up to the skies, we wonder how vast the universe is.
Here we will explore the size of our known universe. First, we will check the size and distance between International Space Station, then we will compare planets with our Sun in our solar system, we will add other celestial bodies like comets and see the difference in trajectory around the Sun, we will check the difference between the distance of other galaxites and Milky Way and their velocities, lastly we will see the difference between temperature and luminosity of stars.

### *1. Comparison - Earth, International Space Station and the Moon*
Imagine, we are flying out of Earthâ€™s atmosphere on a space shuttle and dock it with the International Space Station. We would be able to see Moon revolving around us and Earth. This is when we would get our first view of the size in relation to other immediate celestial bodies. Below, first interactive visualization (here only the screenshot of it) lets us rotate Moon around the Earth and this lets us realize how far the Moon really is from the Earth. Here, ISS is a little far from Earth and its size is enlarged, otherwise it would be the size of a single pixel.

Next, we will move out of the solar system to see all the planets and out Sun.

### *2. Sizes of the solar system*

### *3. Comets, planets and gravitational force of the Sun*

### *4. Distance vs Luminosity*
90% of galaxies are similar sizes, and there are huge and far away from our Milkyway.

### *Summary*

*Samples*

Plain-text example: `_posts`

Ruby code snippet example:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
