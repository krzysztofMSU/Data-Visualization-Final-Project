## Data Visualization Final Project, Spring 2019

### *Introduction*
When we look up to the skies, we wonder how vast the universe is.
Here we will explore the size of our known universe. First, we will check the size and distance between International Space Station, then we will compare planets with our Sun in our solar system, we will add other celestial bodies like comets and see the difference in trajectory around the Sun, we will check the difference between the distance of other galaxites and Milky Way and their velocities, lastly we will see the difference between temperature and luminosity of stars.

### *1. Comparison - Earth, International Space Station and the Moon*
Imagine, we are flying out of Earth’s atmosphere on a space shuttle and dock it with the International Space Station. We would be able to see Moon revolving around us and Earth. This is when we would get our first view of the size in relation to other immediate celestial bodies Earth and the Moon. If we move a little farther and gain more distance from the Earth and the ISS, we can have even better view of Earth, ISS and the Mon. Below is our first 3D interactive visualization (here only the screenshot of it) that lets us rotate Moon and ISS around the Earth. The ISS is a farther from Earth – it’s out beyond Earth’s outer atmosphere and its size is enlarged; otherwise, if we projected real size of the ISS, it would be the size of a single pixel. This view gives us better understanding of the relation between Earth, ISS and the Moon.

Next, we will move out of the solar system to see all the planets and our Sun.

### *2. Sizes of the solar system*

Sun is the largest and as we move away from the it, we see all the planets in order. In this 3D visualization (here only the screenshot of it) we can see Earth as a tiny dot, the third object from the Sun. Here we focus on the size and the distances between planets are arbitrary in order to fit all planets in the view and still see the smaller planets. We don’t show moons here, as they would be too small to see with this too scale visualization. To see a different angle of the planets we can rotate them all around the Sun.

Next, we will check out the speed of planets while they revolve around the Sun.

### *3. Speed of Planets, a Comet and gravitational force of the Sun*

Another perspective shows us the dynamic of our solar system. In the animation below (here only the screenshot of it) we see planets and a comet on their way around the Sun. We can see the difference in speed. Planets closer to the Sun revolve more frequently around the Sun, this is due to shorter circumference of their path. We also notice the elliptical paths. The gravitational interaction of planets and comets distorts the circular shape of the path of all planets. They all revolve in different shapes of ellipses. The comet’s path is much different from the planets, it’s path goes between planets, however most comets do not collide with planets because their path plane is not shared with the plane of planets.

### *4. Distance vs Luminosity*
90% of galaxies are similar sizes, and there are huge and far away from our Milkyway.

### *Summary*

*Samples*

Plain-text example: `_posts`

Ruby code snippet example:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
