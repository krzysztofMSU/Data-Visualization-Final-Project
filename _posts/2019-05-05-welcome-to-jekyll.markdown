### *Introduction*

When we look up to the skies, we wonder how vast the universe is.
Here we will explore the size of our known universe. First, we will check the size and distance between International Space Station, then we will compare planets with our Sun in our solar system, we will add other celestial bodies like comets and see the difference in trajectory around the Sun, we will check the difference between the distance of other galaxies and Milky Way and their velocities, lastly we will see the difference between temperature and luminosity of stars.

### *Earth, International Space Station and the Moon*
Imagine, we are flying out of Earth’s atmosphere on a space shuttle and dock with the International Space Station (ISS). We would be able to see Moon revolving around us and the Earth. This is when we would get our first view of the size in relation to other immediate celestial bodies: The Earth and The Moon. If we move a little farther and gain more distance from the Earth and the ISS, we can have even better view of Earth, ISS and the Mon. Below is our first 3D interactive visualization (here only the screenshot of it) that lets us rotate Moon and ISS around Earth. The ISS is farther from Earth (not to scale) – it’s out beyond Earth’s outer atmosphere and its size is enlarged; otherwise, if we projected real size of the ISS it would be the size of a single pixel.

### *Sizes of the solar system*

Next, we will move out of the solar system to see all the planets and our Sun.

Sun is the largest and as we move away from it, we see all the planets in order. In this 3D visualization (here only the screenshot of it) we can see Earth as a tiny dot, the third object from the Sun. Here our focus is on the size of planets; the distances between planets are arbitrary in order to fit all planets into the view. We don’t show moons here, as they would be too small to see with this too scale visualization. To see a different angle of the planets we can rotate them all around the Sun.

### *Speed of Planets, a Comet and gravitational force of the Sun*

Now let’s check out the speed of planets as they revolve around the Sun.

Another perspective shows us a different dynamic of our solar system. In the animation below (here only the screenshot of it) we see planets and a comet on their way around the Sun. We can see the difference in speed. Planets closer to the Sun revolve more frequently around the Sun, this is due to shorter circumference of their path. We also notice the elliptical paths. The gravitational interaction of planets and comets distorts the circular shape of the path for all planets. They all revolve in different shapes of ellipses. The comet’s path is different from the planets, its path goes between planets, however most comets do not collide with planets because their path plane is not shared with the plane of planets.

### *Velocity of other galaxies away from Earth*

Latest research gave us a lot of data for the relation between distance and velocity of galaxies.

In the figure below the distance (x-axis) to other galaxies measured from our Milky Way and the velocity (y-axis) tell us about the expansion. A few galaxies relatively close to Milky Way move through space at similar rate and when we compare them with other galaxies much farther away from us, the velocity is exponential. For this comparison, if we consider the speed of light to be constant, we see that the difference in velocity increases at a very rapid rate.

### *Hertzprung-Russell Diagram - Stars temperature and luminosity with respect to mass*

The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram plots stars according to their surface temperatures and luminosity.

The brightness of a star depends on the amount of light it emits into space and its distance from Earth. We can measure it through stellar parallax (apparent shift of position of any nearby star against the background of any other distant object). There are numerous classifications of stars based on their temperature and mass. The H-R diagram shows clear pattern between size, temperature and mass. The super giants in the top-right and the smallest white-dwarfs in the lower-left. Our Sun is in the group of the main-sequence stars.

3D view (here only the screenshot of it) of the H-R size, mass and luminosity also compared to our Sun.

### *Summary*

All this data, especially when visualized give us better understanding of our visible universe. We can better understand our solar system when we see the difference in size between planets. When we simulate the rotation of planets around Sun it shows us the difference of the planetary years between them. The universe expansion and the enormous distances and between stars and galaxies with respect to temperature, luminosity and mass tell us how small we all are here on Earth. The interactive and 3-D visualizations help us understand the data, and the static plots support our understanding of the physics of our existence.
