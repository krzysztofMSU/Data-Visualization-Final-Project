### *Introduction*
When we look up to the skies, we wonder how vast the universe is.
Here we will explore the size of our known universe. First, we will check the size and distance between International Space Station, then we will compare planets with our Sun in our solar system, we will add other celestial bodies like comets and see the difference in trajectory around the Sun, we will check the difference between the distance of other galaxites and Milky Way and their velocities, lastly we will see the difference between temperature and luminosity of stars.

### *1. Comparison - Earth and the moon*
Imagine, we are flying out of Earthâ€™s atmosphere on a space shuttle and dock it with the International Space Station. We see passing Moon and get the first glimpse on the size in relation to other celestial bodies.
As small as we are here on the Earth, we can see that the size of our planet and our Moon is big. The distance between them is already enormous.

### *2. Sizes of the solar system*

Cluster of our observable part of universe:

### *3. Comets, planets and gravitational force of the Sun*

### *4. Distance vs Luminosity*
90% of galaxies are similar sizes, and there are huge and far away from our Milkyway.

### *Summary*

*Samples*

Plain-text example: `_posts`

Ruby code snippet example:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
