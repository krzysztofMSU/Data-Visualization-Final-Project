You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}


1 - Comparison - Earth and the moon
Imagine, we are flying out of Earth’s atmosphere on a space shuttle and dock it with the International Space Station. We see passing Moon and get the first glimpse on the size in relation to other celestial bodies.
As small as we are here on the Earth, we can see that the size of our planet and our Moon is big. The distance between them is already enormous.

Solar system:

2 – computational. Comets, planets. Gravitational force of the Sun. 

3 – sizes of solar system. 

Cluster of our observable part of universe:

4 – 90% of galaxies are similar sizes, and there are huge and far away from our Milkyway.

5 – H-R diagram: temperature, luminosity, mass, volume.
