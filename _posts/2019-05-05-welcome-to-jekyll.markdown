### *Introduction*

Plain-text example: `_posts`

Ruby code snippet example:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

### *1. Comparison - Earth and the moon*
Imagine, we are flying out of Earthâ€™s atmosphere on a space shuttle and dock it with the International Space Station. We see passing Moon and get the first glimpse on the size in relation to other celestial bodies.
As small as we are here on the Earth, we can see that the size of our planet and our Moon is big. The distance between them is already enormous.

### *4. Distance vs Luminosity*
90% of galaxies are similar sizes, and there are huge and far away from our Milkyway.
